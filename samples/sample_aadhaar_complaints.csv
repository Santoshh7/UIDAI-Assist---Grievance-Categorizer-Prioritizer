complaint
I applied for my Aadhaar card 3 months ago and it still hasn't been delivered.
My fingerprint was not recognized during authentication at the ration shop.
There is a wrong date of birth printed on my Aadhaar card.
"I tried to update my mobile number, but it keeps failing with a biometric error."
My name is misspelled in the Aadhaar card.
I have submitted the complaint multiple times but havenâ€™t received a resolution yet.
The photo on the Aadhaar is not mine. It looks like someone else.
"Despite submitting correct details, authentication keeps failing at the bank."
I got my Aadhaar card but the QR code doesn't work.
"Even after successful enrollment, my Aadhaar was not generated."
